# Block Breaker++

A few weeks ago, I started on the Udemy course [Learn to Code by Making Games - Complete Unity 5 Developer](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/#/) and just completed my edition of Block Breaker (an Arkanoids clone). However, to stretch myself a bit, I added the following:

* A level editor.

* The ability to save and load custom levels.

* A level system created at runtime. In other words, there are no pre-built scenes acting as full levels, just a play area ready to be populated with bricks from either a pre-built level or a custom level.

It's still rough around the edges, but it's more than ready enough for showing. So, here it is: Block Breaker++
